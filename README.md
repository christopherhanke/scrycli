# scrycli
This is a personal learning repository, working with an API in CLI.

# Learning Project
In this project I want to accomplish:
* building a CLI (user input)
* call API (with user data)
* work with response (data manipulation)


## Minimum Viable Project (MVP)
I want to have a CLI where I can search for card names and get all cards back that match the given information.
